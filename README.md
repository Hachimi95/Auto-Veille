## 🚀 Installation (on a VM, no Git required)

1) Copy the project folder to the VM
   - Windows: e.g., C:\Auto-Veille
   - Linux: e.g., /opt/auto-veille

2) Install Python 3.10+ and create a virtual environment
   - Windows:
     - py -3.10 -m venv .venv
     - .\.venv\Scripts\activate
   - Linux:
     - python3 -m venv .venv
     - source .venv/bin/activate

3) Install dependencies
   - python -m pip install --upgrade pip wheel setuptools
   - pip install -r requirements.txt

4) Set up environment variables
   - python setup_env.py
   - Edit the generated .env and set:
     - OPENROUTER_API_KEY=...
     - OPENROUTER_API_KEY_BACKUP=...
     - COHERE_API_KEY=...

5) Initialize the database
   - python setup_db.py

6) First run (development)
   - python app.py
   - Access: http://<VM-IP>:5000 (ensure the VM firewall allows the port)

## 🖥️ VM Deployment (Production)

- Windows (Waitress)
  - Run in foreground for a quick start:
    - .\.venv\Scripts\python -m waitress --listen=0.0.0.0:5000 app:app
  - Optional: Auto-start on boot via Task Scheduler (simplest)
    - Create a basic task that runs:
      - Program: C:\Path\to\project\.venv\Scripts\python.exe
      - Arguments: -m waitress --listen=0.0.0.0:5000 app:app
      - Start in: C:\Path\to\project

- Linux (Gunicorn + systemd)
  - Quick run:
    - .venv/bin/gunicorn -w 2 -b 0.0.0.0:8000 app:app
  - Example systemd unit (/etc/systemd/system/auto-veille.service):
    - [Unit]
      - Description=Auto-Veille
      - After=network.target
    - [Service]
      - WorkingDirectory=/opt/auto-veille
      - Environment="PATH=/opt/auto-veille/.venv/bin"
      - ExecStart=/opt/auto-veille/.venv/bin/gunicorn -w 2 -b 0.0.0.0:8000 app:app
      - Restart=always
    - [Install]
      - WantedBy=multi-user.target
    - Then:
      - sudo systemctl daemon-reload
      - sudo systemctl enable --now auto-veille

- Reverse proxy (optional)
  - You can place Nginx/Apache/IIS in front to terminate TLS and proxy to 127.0.0.1:5000/8000.

- Folder permissions
  - Ensure the service account can read/write:
    - uploads/
    - exports/
    - vuln_tracker.db (created by setup_db.py in the project root)

- Firewall
  - Open the chosen port (5000 or 8000) on the VM and any upstream firewalls.

## 🔧 Configuration

### Client Configuration (`client_config.json`)
Configure which clients are affected by which products and assign responsible teams:

```json
{
  "Fortinet": {
    "clients": ["CDGDev", "CDG", "Idarati"],
    "responsible_team": "Network"
  },
  "Google Chrome": {
    "clients": ["CDGDev", "CDG"],
    "responsible_team": "PDT"
  }
}
```

## 📋 Usage

### 1. Upload Security Bulletin
1. Navigate to the upload page
2. Select a PDF security bulletin
3. The system will extract vulnerability information using AI
4. Review the extracted data in the tracker
5. Confirm and save to database when ready

### 2. Track Vulnerabilities
